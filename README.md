# clang-libdos

This is work in progress, but the parts finished are usable.

### What's this?

In short: A little collection trying to mimic the most basic parts of a C
standard library for *real mode* DOS programs (`.COM` files).

If you try creating a *real mode* DOS program, you either use some ages-old
compilers (or, compilers using ages-old syntax ... *K&R* that is), or you're
completely on your own, left with nothing but the BIOS and DOS *interrupt
routines*, accessible through inline assembly. This random collection of code
tries to fill the gap.

`LLVM/clang` (and, more recently, `GCC`) provide the `-m16` switch for
compiling to *real mode* code. It's a bit counter-intuitive, because this
still creates code making use of all the *long* instructions and 32bit
registers, so the code will not work on any processor that doesn't support the
whole *i386* instruction set. It just means it will run in the 16bit-"based"
*real mode*, so it's possible to create a DOS `.COM` executable with a little
linker magic. Read [this very interesting blog post by Christopher
Wellons](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/12/09/) for more details -- it's a
great read and it was written before the `-m16` switch was introduced, so
things were even more complicated.

### How does this relate to clang?

Well, `GCC` seems still a bit more *buggy* with `-m16` than `clang`. `clang`
already does a great job optimizing the code without breaking it for *real
mode*. Unfortunately, this doesn't hold for *link time optimizations*, they
**will** break your program (as soon as it's non-trivial) even with `clang`.
Apart from that, there's one issue: *real mode* applications typically use
BIOS and DOS *interrupt routines*. Some BIOSes are buggy. There's at least one
routine (the one for scrolling the console, so something needed regularly) I
know of that clobbers the `ebp` (base pointer for the current stack frame)
register on buggy BIOSes. Declaring that in your inline assembly, `GCC` just
refuses to compile.[1] `clang` doesn't complain. As I don't know of any other
*modern* compilers targeting *real mode*, this project is now tied to `clang`.

## Features

 - basic heap management (`malloc()` and friends). `realloc()` is currently
   untested, `calloc()` is not (yet?) supported.

 - A non-standard `conio.h` interface aiming to provide an API around the most
   commonly used `int 10h` BIOS routines.

 - A non-standard `rtctimer.h` providing a waitable timer on top of BIOS RTC
   timer routines. Values are given in microseconds, but the typical precision
   available is 977 Âµs.

 - very limited `libc` functionality, including the `*printf()` family [2],
   error handling through `errno.h`, *some* `string.h` functions, *some*
   `time.h` functions, a very simple PRNG for `rand()` and *fake* stdio
   streams just for `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`. See the source for
   details.

## Why?

Because we can. My goal right now is to implement enough *runtime foo* to get
my [cursedsnake game](https://github.com/Zirias/cursedsnake) to compile to a
working `.COM` file. Just for fun.

## How to use?

See the Makefile in this repository. As *link time optimizations* currently
break your code, the only way is to compile all `libdos` source files together
with your own source files in a single compiler run. (Don't forget `.COM` is
limited to 64KB - `0x100`. Linking object files without *link time
optimizations* therefore isn't really an option.)

**Important**: `core.c` **must** be the first source file on your `clang`
commandline. It contains the startup code and as `.COM` doesn't have any
headers, whatever comes first in the binary will be executed at startup.

If you don't need commandline arguments in your program (so, if your main
function is declared `int main(void)`), pass `-DNOARGV` to save a few bytes in
the startup code.

## Footnotes

 - [1] The `Linux` kernel uses `GCC` for its bootcode. They came up with a big
       wrapper done in assembly around BIOS *interrupt routines* saving and
       restoring **all** registers, obviously being fed up with BIOS bugs. Of
       course, that's a nice approach for boot code, but in your *real mode*
       DOS application, you probably don't want to do such a thing.

 - [2] In the current implementation, the only format specifiers allowed are
       `s`, `d`, `u`, `x` and `X`. Flags for padding (` ` and `0`) and
       field-widths are understood as well as length specifiers from `hh` to
       `l`. No advanced features of `printf()` are supported and there's
       barely any error-checking, so be careful with your format strings. For
       `s`, any flags and field-widths are currently ignored.
